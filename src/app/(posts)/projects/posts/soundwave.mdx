Built during my Junior year of college, Soundwave is a minigame that explores a novel method for computer interaction that moved away from traditional input devices.

It works by tracking the user's hand position in virtual space using a webcam. Additionally, a using a collision detection algorithm I was able to trigger haptics on designed glove allowing users to interact with digital content on a tactile level, effectively merging the digital and physical realms.

Soundwave leverages websockets for real time communication between the microcontroller and the web application.

The hand position is then sent to Web Socket server that broadcasts to the arduino microcontroller which controls the vibration of the glove."

## Conclusion & Learnings

There's alot of potential for new forms of input and I'm excited to see where this line of research takes us in the coming years.
Some ideas in this space that I think are interesting:
